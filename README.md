# MikroTik BT5 tag scanner for ESP32

This is simple library for parsing MikroTik [TG-BT5-IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/tg_bt5_in) and [TG-BT5-OUT](https://mikrotik.com/product/tg_bt5_out) advertisement packets.

I strongly recommend to use [NimBLE-Arduino](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino) Bluetooth Library as it will use less flash size and will allow to use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth code at the same time.

See examples for basic usage.
